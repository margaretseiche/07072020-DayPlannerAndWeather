## Description
I combined 2 previous projects --- a day planner and a weather search engine.  I combined them into one index file.  To make the code less confusing, I left the style sheets and script files separate.  

I found a few spots with common names (like 'row') and changed them so that they would not interfere with each other.

For the Day Planner, I tailored the heading font.  I also added a 'delete' button with a trash can icon.

For weather
* I found the degree symbol.  Using \u2109 includes the degree symbol and F (for Fahrenheit), which saves space.
* Because the date and time are already at the top, I removed those repetitive parts from today's weather.
